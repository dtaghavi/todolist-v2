# todolist-v2
This is version 2 of the Todolist. It is now working using a local mongoDB server vs. static arrays.


How to setup:

  1) Git clone the project
  CD to project folder
  git install
  
  2) start up your local mongodb server
  
  3) Run your app.js
  
  Done
  
How to use:

  localhost:3000 for a daily Todo list
  
  And if you need a more specific todo list you can go to
  
  localhost:3000/"Name of list"
  
  If it is new the list will be created otherwise it will look up your already existing list from your database.
